# Unhandled Exception Leading to Unreachable Code in MATLAB

This repository demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, error in MATLAB: unhandled exceptions leading to unreachable code.  The `bug.m` file contains a function with a potential error; if this error occurs, a subsequent line of code will never execute.

The solution, shown in `bugSolution.m`, demonstrates the importance of robust error handling to prevent unexpected behavior and ensure code reliability.  Proper error handling prevents unexpected termination and enables more graceful handling of unusual situations.
